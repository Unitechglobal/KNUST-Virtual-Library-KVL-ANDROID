             KNUST VIRTUAL LIBRARY (KVL)
    
        Background
This project evolved purposely as a chosen project for Software Engineering, a third year computer engineering course offered in KNUST. It is being developed by a team of six (all guys). 
The idea of a virtual library was brought about to provide easy and mobile access to all lecture materials as well as additional academic resources. The hope is for this to provide the needed bridge between a physical library and the emerging screen trends.

        Project Overview
For the time being the virtual library is to be implemented through an android application for base testing and prototyping. If successful the project will then move to phase two where plans are being made for an ios application and then a web application.

        Overall Description
KVL for the time being is going to be an android application that allows users to access(download and read) lecture materials for the various courses offered in KNUST as well as additional resources that may be deemed necessary by the librarians.
